## Basic Concepts

This workshop uses the inherent functionality of GitHub called [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to render this website

- It also uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) Ruby gem used for the layout and serving static content
- We are also using a jekyll theme called [Just the docs](https://jekyll-themes.com/just-the-docs/), and [here](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/  ) is the documentation for it 
- Once you have sucessfully installed. Run `<bundle install>` from the root folder (docs in this case)
- To run the app `<bundle exec jekyll serve>`
